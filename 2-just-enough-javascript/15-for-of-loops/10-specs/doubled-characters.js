/*
  a user can input string of letters (upper or lower case), each letter will be doubled
    - given the user cancels, they will be prompted again
    - given the input is empty, they will be prompted again
    - given their input contains anything that is not a letter, they will be prompted again
    - given their input is valid, the loop will exit and the letters of their input will be doubled


  test cases:
    no doubled letters:
      'ABC' -> 'AABBCC'
      'abc' -> 'aabbcc'
      'AbC' -> 'AAbbCC'
    some doubled letters:
      'abbcc' -> 'aabbbbcccc'
      'jello' -> 'jjeelllloo'

  checklist:
    [ ] the code is formatted
    [ ] linting check passes
    [ ] variable names are clear and helpful
    [ ] each line of code is explained in a comment above that line
      - use full sentences and correct JS vocabulary
    [ ] the program runs
    [ ] the program has no errors
    [ ] all of the test cases work
    [ ] you tested strange inputs that could break your program (edge cases)
